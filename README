TransGC

This is a previous work I've done on based on hotspot6 on OpenJDK. The project is named TransGC, meaning transactional GC. 
It contains the hacks that I made on hotspot to group objects into different transactional areas so that we can reclaim the 
space once the transaction is over. 

The implementation is complete, but unfortunately the overhead is not acceptable. It runs with real benchmarks like specj2004, 
but the performance is not as good as expected, that's why it's not published into a paper yet. But I would like to still share 
this code just in case anyone is interested.
